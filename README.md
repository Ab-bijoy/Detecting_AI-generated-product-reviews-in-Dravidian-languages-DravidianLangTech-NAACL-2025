# Detecting AI-Generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages

This repository contains the implementation details and codebase for the Shared Task on Detecting AI-Generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages, as part of DravidianLangTech@NAACL 2025.

## Overview
The primary goal of this task is to classify product reviews as AI-generated or human-written in various Dravidian languages. This repository employs state-of-the-art transformer models, deep learning architectures, and traditional machine learning techniques to achieve this objective.

## Approach

### Transformer Models
We leveraged pre-trained transformer models for feature extraction and classification:
- `idajikuu/AI-HUMAN-detector`
- `akshayvkt/detect-ai-text`

### Deep Learning Models
We implemented and fine-tuned the following deep learning architectures:
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**
- **Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTM)**

### Machine Learning Models
We trained and evaluated traditional machine learning models for this task:
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **XGBoost**
- **Decision Tree**
## Results
| Model Type           | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Transformer          | XX.XX%  | XX.XX%    | XX.XX% | XX.XX%   |
| Deep Learning (LSTM) | XX.XX%  | XX.XX%    | XX.XX% | XX.XX%   |
| Machine Learning     | XX.XX%  | XX.XX%    | XX.XX% | XX.XX%   |
